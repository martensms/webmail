# Minimalistic Webmail Interface

This fork is based on [Cookie Engineer](https://cookie.engineer)'s provided
Webmail project and an attempt to refactor it into node.js.

The original project is/was written in old PHP, and therefore this will most
likely be a complete rewrite. As the original project did not include any
license, I've received explicit permission by Cookie Engineer to reuse the
original codebase under `WTFPL`.

Work in Progress, so don't use it in production.
